PHP FORM ENCRYPTION

Change log.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.01    2016-09-09:
- PHP class has now more control over the RSA key pair creation.
- JavaScript class now detects RSA key change, and generates automatically a
  new AES key that's sent to the server. This means no need to manually reset
  the browser local session storage when session is destroyed and restarted, or
  when RSA keys are reset.


Version 1.00    2016-08-17:
- First public version.
